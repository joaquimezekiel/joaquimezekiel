Create Python Program that answers the following question:
“How much building materials are needed to cover the entire floor as well as how much baseboard we should have that will be installed into the room”
Imagine that you would like to remodel one of your rooms in your house/home/apparent. Select any room of your choice and measure it. Have all the measurements ready and use them as input parameters to your Python program.
